In this paper, we described an operational semantics for a forward-chaining
linear logic programming language with support for comprehensions, aggregates
and rule priorities. We started with a simple fragment of linear logic which was
then expanded to HLD semantics, a proof system based on focusing with
forwards-chaining on the sequent calculus. The LLAM removed the non-determinism
of HLD to complete the full semantics of LM. The LLAM specifies in detail how
linear facts are managed when matching a rule, that is, by storing continuation
frames and backtracking when matching fails. This mechanism is essential for
deriving comprehensions and aggregates, since these require matching all the
combinations from the database. We also presented an overview of the soundness
proof, which relates the LLAM with the HLD semantics and can be seen as a
mapping between a abstract machine that determines all the steps of the
computation process with focused proofs in the sequent calculus.
