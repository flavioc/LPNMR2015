In this paper, we described an operational semantics for a forward-chaining
linear logic programming language with support for comprehensions and
aggregates. We started with \fragment, a intuitionistic linear logic system,
which was expanded to HLD semantics, a proof system based on focusing with
forwards-chaining on the sequent calculus. The LLD semantics removed the
non-determinism of HLD to complete the full semantics of LM. LLD specifies in
detail how linear facts are managed when matching a rule, that is, by storing
choice points and backtracking when matching fails. This mechanism is essential
for deriving comprehensions and aggregates, which requires matching all the
combinations from the database.
