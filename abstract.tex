We specify the semantics of LM, a forward-chaining linear logic programming
language that supports comprehensions, aggregates and rule priorities.
Comprehensions iterate over combinations of facts to generate other facts while
aggregates iterate over facts to aggregate values. We present the linear logic
fragment used in the language and a high level dynamic semantics that closely
mimics forward-chaining with focusing on the sequent calculus.  We also describe
the LLAM, a low level abstract machine that describes the full operational
behaviour of the language and is much closer to a concrete implementation. We
prove that the LLAM is sound in relation to the high level semantics, meaning
that any computation performed in the former can also be done in the latter. The
soundness proof further shows how focused proofs with forward-chaining can be
mapped to a low level representation that determines all the steps of the
computation process.
