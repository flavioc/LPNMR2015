We describe the LLAM, an abstract machine that specifies the operational
behaviour of a linear logic programming language that supports comprehensions
and aggregates. Comprehensions iterate over combinations of facts to generate
other facts while aggregates iterate over facts to aggregate values. We present
the linear logic fragment used in the language and a high level dynamic
semantics that closely mimics forward-chaining with focusing on the sequent
calculus.  We prove that the LLAM is sound in relation to the high level
semantics, meaning that any computation performed in the former can also be done
in the latter. The soundness proof further shows how focused proofs with
forward-chaining can be mapped to a low level representation that determines all
the steps of the computation process.
