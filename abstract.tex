We specify the semantics of LM, a forward-chaining linear logic programming
language that supports comprehensions, aggregates and rule priorities.
Comprehensions iterate over combinations of facts in the database to generate
facts, while aggregates iterate over the database to accumulate and aggregate
values. We present the linear logic fragment used in the language and a high
level dynamic semantics that closely mimics forward-chaining with focusing on
the sequent calculus of the logic. We also describe the low level dynamic
semantics, an abstract machine that describes the full operational behaviour of
the language and is much closer to a concrete implementation. We prove that the
low level dynamic semantics is sound in relation to the high level semantics,
meaning that any computation performed in the former can also be done in the
latter.  The soundness proof further shows how focused proofs with
forward-chaining can be mapped to a low level representation that determines all
the steps of the computation process.
