We specify the semantics of LM, a forward-chaining linear logic programming language
that supports comprehensions and aggregates. Comprehensions iterate over
combinations of facts in the database to generate facts, while aggregates
iterate over the database to accumulate and aggregate values.  We present the
sequent calculus of \fragment, a linear logic system used as a foundation for
LM. We specify 2 levels of dynamic semantics: (1) the high level
dynamic semantics, which performs forward-chaining with focusing on the sequent
calculus and (2) the low level dynamic semantics, which describe the full
operational behaviour of the language and is much closer to a concrete
implementation.  We prove that the low level dynamic semantics is sound in
relation to the high level semantics, meaning that any computation performed in
the former can also be done in the latter. The soundness proof further shows how
focused proofs with forward-chaining can be mapped to a low level representation
that determines all the steps of the computation process.
